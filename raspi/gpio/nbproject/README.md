# CPP_EXAMPLES_RASPI
Raspberry Pi C++ Examples
author: garrigueta

This exmples are used to manipulate raspberry ports using c++ linux libs.

All you need is to open this repo using Netbeans with c/c++ modules installed.

In Windows install c++ compiler like CygWin with "Devel" checkbox checked as "Install".

I'm trying to create a bunch of classes to use Raspberry GPIO ports.

My goal to acomplish is create an ad-hoc wireless connection between 2 raspberry pi, in this case i'm using a Model B connecting to a Model A+. Model B has a PiTft plugged on it.

All classes ara using linux x86 compier, by adding raspberry pi to Netbeans as BuildHost you can deploy all code on it. This makes more easly all build process because you can build, deploy, locally or remotelly at same time.

Please feel free to use, add or share this code.
